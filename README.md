# Google API Ruby Client (0.8.x) Samples

This repository contains contributed samples for version 0.8x of the
[ruby client](https://github.com/google/google-api-ruby-client). They are
not compatible with version 0.9 of the client library which uses a different
calling style.

Updated samples for version 0.9 may be found in the
[ruby client repository](https://github.com/google/google-api-ruby-client/samples).
The [migration guide](https://github.com/google/google-api-ruby-client/MIGRATION.md)
may also be useful in translating samples to 0.9.
