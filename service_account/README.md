# Google Analytics API & Service Accounts Ruby Sample

This is a command line example of calling the Google Analytics API & service accounts. 

## Prerequisites

Please make sure that you're running Ruby 1.8.7+ and you've run
`bundle install` on the sample to install all prerequisites.

## Setup Authentication

This API uses OAuth 2.0 with service accounts. Learn more about Google APIs and OAuth 2.0 here:
https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2

Or, if you'd like to dive right in, follow these steps.
 - Visit https://code.google.com/apis/console/ to register your application.
 - From the "Project Home" screen, activate access to "Google+ API".
 - Click on "API Access" in the left column
 - Click the button labeled "Create an OAuth 2.0 client ID"
 - Give your application a name and click "Next"
 - Select "Service Account" as the "Application type"
 - Select "other" under "Installed application type"
 - Click "Create client ID"
 - Click 'Download private key' to save the generate private key file

Also:
 - In analytics, invite the service account email as a user to the project
 - Gather your [Profile Id][pi] (which is not your Account ID but your View ID)

Edit ga_config.yml with your apps' ID & credentials along with your analytics profile ID:

Edit analytics.rb with start and end date limits for data extraction

Edit ga_attributes.yml with details of dimensions and metrics to generate reports
hash key in the yml file will be used to name the file to write each report
