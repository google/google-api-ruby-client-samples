# AdSense Ruby Sample

This is a simple starter project written in Ruby which provides a minimal
example of Google AdSense integration within a command line application.

Once you've run the starter project and played with the features it provides,
this starter project provides a great place to start your experimentation into
the API.

## Prerequisites

Please make sure that you're running Ruby 1.8.7+ and you've run
`bundle install` on the sample to install all prerequisites.
